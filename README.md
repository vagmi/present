# Present

An opinionated, production-grade foundation for SaaS applications. It makes the
hard architectural decisions for you (authentication, multi-tenancy, a typed
data layer, and subscription billing). So you start from solid engineering
fundamentals instead of a blank page.

- 🔐 **Auth & multi-tenancy** — Clerk with organizations; users, memberships & roles mirrored into D1; every record scoped to an org
- 🛡️ **Authorization** — one auditable policy file (`app/lib/capabilities.ts`); role checks read the live Clerk session, enforced server-side and reflected in the UI
- 🗄️ **Typed data layer** — Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle ORM with strict controller → service → repository layering and migrations
- 💳 **Pricing Plans & limits** — tier-based gating and live usage metering built in; subscription billing (Polar) is one skill away
- 🎨 **UI** — Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui with a considered design system
- ✅ **Tested** — every layer ships with a spec; full type-checking across app and worker

Everything runs on a single Cloudflare Worker — React Router v7 (SSR) for the
app and a Hono API at `/api`, sharing one codebase and one deploy.

## Claude Code - Quick Start

Open Claude Code and run **`/onboard`** — it walks you through
setup to a green environment, interviews you about your app, and writes a phased
roadmap of small, deployable vertical slices to `docs/roadmap.md`.

## Non-AI - Quick Start (if you prefer to do it manually)

```bash
pnpm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars        # server secrets — fill in
cp .env.local.example .env.local      # browser Clerk key — fill in
npx wrangler d1 create present  # create your D1 database
# paste the printed database_id into wrangler.jsonc
pnpm db:migrate:local
pnpm doctor                            # verifies your setup
pnpm dev
```

See **[docs/workshop.md](docs/workshop.md)** for the full setup checklist
(Clerk app + organizations, D1, Polar products) and a step-by-step guide.

## Dev container / Codespaces

The repo ships a dev container (`.devcontainer/`). On create it installs
dependencies, writes your secrets into `.dev.vars` and `.env.local`, and applies
the D1 migrations — so the app boots with `pnpm dev` straight away.

Secrets flow in through `devcontainer.json`'s `remoteEnv`, which maps the
variables below from the host environment into the container:

- **GitHub Codespaces** — add them under
  *Repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Codespaces*.
- **Local dev container** — export them in your shell before opening the
  folder in the container (`${localEnv:...}` reads your host environment).

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | ✅ | Server-side Clerk key; must be set for `.dev.vars` to be generated |
| `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | ✅ | Clerk publishable key; used server-side and also written to `.env.local` for the browser |
| `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | optional | Overrides the browser key in `.env.local` if it differs from `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` |
| `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | optional | Verifies Clerk webhooks (placeholder used if unset) |
| `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` | optional | Polar billing (only if the `billing-polar` skill is installed) |
| `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | optional | Verifies Polar webhooks (placeholder used if unset) |
| `POLAR_PRO_PRODUCT_ID` / `POLAR_BIZ_PRODUCT_ID` | optional | Polar product ids for the Pro / Business tiers |
| `POLAR_SERVER` | optional | `sandbox` (default) or `production` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | optional | Transactional email (`email-resend` skill) |
| `SVIX_API_KEY` | optional | Outbound webhooks (`webhooks-svix` skill) |
| `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | optional | Public base URL of the R2 bucket, e.g. `https://pub-xxxx.r2.dev` (`r2-uploads` skill) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | optional | Required to deploy from inside the container — see below |

### Deploying from a Codespace

`npx wrangler login` does **not** work inside a Codespace: its OAuth flow needs
a browser callback to `localhost`, which never reaches the container. Use an
API token instead:

1. Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
   → *My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token* and use the **Edit Cloudflare
   Workers** template (add *D1 Edit* if you want to run remote migrations).
2. Save it as a `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` Codespaces secret (or export it in your
   shell for a local dev container).

Wrangler picks the token up from the environment automatically — no login
needed. If your token spans multiple Cloudflare accounts, also export
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` so wrangler knows which one to deploy to.

If `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` isn't present, `post-create.sh` falls back to copying
`.dev.vars.example`, and you'll need to fill in real keys before signing in.
Existing `.dev.vars` / `.env.local` files are never overwritten, so re-creating
the container won't clobber local edits.


## Architecture

Strict layering keeps the codebase predictable as it grows:

```
controller → service → repository → Drizzle/D1
```

Controllers validate input and shape responses; services own business rules
(tier gates, usage metering); repositories are the only place database queries
live, and every query is scoped to the active organization. React Router
loaders call the same Hono API in-process, so there is exactly one API surface.

Read **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** for the full design and
**[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** for conventions and rules.

## The example resource

`items` is a complete vertical slice — schema, repository, service, controller,
dashboard UI, and tests, including a tier-based limit and live usage metering.
It's the reference pattern: copy it to add your own resource (duplicate the
schema, repo, service, controller, route, and tests, then rename `item` → your
domain object).

## Optional features (skills)

The base template is designed to be lean. You can add more features by using the skills shipped with this project.
Capabilities you may or may not need ship as installable **skills**. Installing
the skill places its implementation guide and reference code into `.claude/skills/`,
ready for an AI coding agent to wire in:

```bash
pnpm install-skill                 # list available skills
pnpm install-skill email-resend    # install one
pnpm install-skill uninstall <n>   # remove one
```

| Skill | Adds |
| --- | --- |
| `app-name` | Rename the app to your own name in one pass |
| `billing-polar` | Subscription billing via Polar (checkout, portal, webhooks, Billing page) |
| `email-resend` | Transactional email via Resend |
| `webhooks-svix` | Organization-scoped outbound webhooks (signed, retried, with a delivery log) |
| `widget-embed` | An embeddable `/widget.js` (Preact, shadow DOM) backed by a public API |
| `r2-uploads` | File uploads to a Cloudflare R2 bucket |

After installing, follow the printed checklist (env vars, bindings, deps); each
skill's `SKILL.md` contains exact integration steps and reference code.
